# Assignment for Lab 06 Verilog

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to get you more familiar and comfortable with design and implement digital circuit with Verilog.

Please read the [coding standard](coding_standard.md).

## Problems

Name the project as "Lab06".

Draw the required block diagrams in a seperate file in this folder
- Name the file as "block_diagrams.md"
- For each block diagram in block_diagram.md, start with a brief description of the block diagram, and embed the diagram / picture under the description. (You should use the format of this assignment).

### 1. Implement and test a N-bit 4-way multiplexer using 2-way multiplexer (2 pts)
- Name this simulation set as "mux4_test"

### 2. Implement and test a N-bit 8-way multiplexer (2 pts)
- Name this simulation set as "mux8_test"

### 3. Implement and test a 4-bit comparator (1 pts)
- Name this simulation set as "comparator4bit_test"
- Note: One way is to implement the comparator using the combinational logic shown in figure 4.17 in text book. However, you should think if that method could scale, will it be able to extend to a comparator with much larger size of input, e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit.

### 4. Implement a 8-bit comparator using 2 4-bit comparator. (2 pts)
- Draw a block diagram of the 8-bit comparator in terms of 4-bit comparator and describe / implement the logic of any unknown modules.
- Name this simulation set as "comparator8bit_test"

### 5. Implement and test N-bit comparator of two inputs, where N=2^n for n is a non-negative integer. (3 pts)
- Draw a a block diagram of the N-bit comparator you are going to implement and describe / implement the logic of any unknown modules.
- Name this simulation set as "comparator_test".
